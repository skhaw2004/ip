# Compiles Stuart and runs three scenarios (all from the project root, so
# its "./data/..." save path resolves correctly):
#   1. input.txt against a clean slate, checking console output
#      (EXPECTED.TXT) and the resulting save file (EXPECTED_DATA.TXT) -
#      exercises writing, including several invalid-input edge cases.
#   2. input_load.txt against a pre-seeded, well-formed save file
#      (seed_data.txt), checking console output (EXPECTED_LOAD.TXT) -
#      exercises loading.
#   3. input_load.txt against a pre-seeded save file with corrupted lines
#      mixed in (seed_data_corrupted.txt), checking console output
#      (EXPECTED_LOAD_CORRUPTED.TXT) - exercises loading resilience.
# Run from anywhere; paths are resolved relative to this script's location.
